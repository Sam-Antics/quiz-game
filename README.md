### Week 4 Challenge
## Project Description
Create a timed quiz game which presents multiple choice questions. When a question is answered incorrectly, time should be deducted from the clock. When the game is over, initials should be requsted so that high scores can be saved and cataloged.
### User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## ISSUES
I spent three weeks trying to wrap my head around JavaScript, and this is the resulting (though incomplete) project for the Module 4 challenge. Getting the HTML and CSS done went pretty quickly, although there was some clean up I intended to do once I got all the JS functionality working:
 * I wanted to make the cards all appear in the same spot on the window object
 * The button wasn't sitting correctly in the form card for entering the player's initials

Unfortunately, I got hung up for hours working through the functions on the "Questions" container. I took an inordinate amount of time to figure out why my questions weren't advancing (it was a simple fix that walking away and coming back with fresh eyes would have solved, if I'd only done that instead of banging my head on the keyboard for 2 hours). That being the case, I was unable to move on to the local storage functionality and decided to submit the assignment as it was.

Once I'm not crosseyed from staring at this specific code anymore, I intend to come back and finish in earnest.
